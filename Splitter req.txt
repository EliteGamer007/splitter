Project Requirements
Continuously updating doc
We are building a Twitter-like microblogging platform with a major architectural twist: it is
Federated (interoperable with other servers) and uses Decentralized Identity (users own their
data/keys).
The Core differentiator: unlike a standard clone, our platform prioritizes User Autonomy (identity
migration), Privacy (E2EE DMs & Groups), and Resilience (surviving network failures).
. Tech Stack (Confirmed)
● Backend: Go (Golang) + Echo/Chi Framework
● Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + ShadcnUI(maybe)
● Database: PostgreSQL (Relational Data) + Redis (Queues/Cache)
● Infrastructure: Docker + Docker Compose
● Protocol: ActivityPub (JSON-LD) + Custom Extensions for E2EE
Detailed Feature Requirements (By Module)
Module A: Identity & User Autonomy
This module handles "Who you are."
● Decentralized Auth:
○ Users sign up/login using a Challenge-Response mechanism (signing a server
nonce), not just a password.
○ DID Generation: On signup, the Frontend generates a Public/Private Key pair
(did:key). The Private Key is stored in the browser (IndexedDB), not sent to the
server.
● Server Selection: Users can choose a "Home Server" from a dropdown during login
(simulated multi-instance).
● Account Migration (Research Feature): A "Digital Suitcase" feature. Users can export
their data + keys as JSON and "Import" it to a new server instance to move their
account.
Module B: Social Feed & Interactions (The "Twitter" Part)
This module handles "What you see."
● Post Types:
○ Standard Post: Text (500 chars) + Images (stored in MinIO/IPFS).
○ Stories (Ephemeral): Posts that auto-expire/delete after 24 hours. (Backend
needs a TTL/Garbage Collector).
● Interactions:
○ Like: Standard heart.
○ Repost (Boost): Shares the post to your followers.
○ Reply: Threaded conversations.
○ Bookmark: Private "Read Later" list (Local only).
● Visibility Scopes (Circles):
○ When posting, user selects audience: Public, Followers Only, or Custom Circle
(e.g., "Study Group").
○ Posts sent to a "Circle" must only be deliverable to those specific users.
Reporting: Users can flag a post as "Spam" or "Harassment" (sends a notification to the Admin
Dashboard).
Module C: Discovery & Trending
This module handles "What is popular."
● Search Engine:
○ Support for Keyword search ("Federation") and Hashtag search ("#GoLang").
○ WebFinger Lookup: Ability to find remote users via handle: @alice@remoteserver.com.
● Trending Section:
○ A side widget showing top Hashtags from the last 24 hours (Aggregated via
Redis).
Module D: Privacy & Messaging
This module handles "Private data."
● Direct Messages (DMs):
○ Separate UI tab (Inbox style).
○ E2EE (End-to-End Encryption): Messages are encrypted on the sender's client
using the recipient's Public Key. The server stores only the cipher blob.
● Privacy Settings:
○ "Lock Account" (Manual approval for followers).
○ "Mute Words" (Regex filter to hide posts containing specific keywords).
Module E: Federation & Resilience (The Backend Engine)
This module handles "The Network."
● ActivityPub Protocol:
○ Inbox: Endpoint to receive JSON payloads from other servers.
○ Outbox: Worker to push JSON payloads to followers on other servers.
○ HTTP Signatures: Every inter-server request must be cryptographically signed.
● Resilience (Research Feature):
○ Retry Queue: If a remote server is down, the message sits in a Redis queue and
retries exponentially (1m, 5m, 1h).
○ Defederation: Admin panel button to "Block Domain" (stops all traffic from evilserver.com).
● Visualizations (Demo Feature):
○ Admin Dashboard: A live Force-Directed Graph showing connected server
nodes.
UI/UX Guidelines
● Design System: Clean, minimalist, "Academic Twitter" vibe.
● Dark/Light Mode: Toggle in the user menu (persisted).
● Indicators:
○ E2EE Lock: Icon on DMs.
○ Federated Badge: Icon on posts that come from a different server.
○ Trust Badge: / Indicator showing if a user is in your "Web of Trust."
Added Core Features (MVP-Critical)
A1. Key Recovery & Rotation (Added Feature)
Applies to: Module A – Identity & User Autonomy
Problem Addressed: Users losing private keys results in permanent account loss.
Requirements:
● Support key rotation: a user may register a new public key by signing a rotation request
with their existing private key.
● Maintain a key revocation list on the server to invalidate compromised or deprecated
keys.
● Optional encrypted recovery bundle exported during signup (encrypted with user
passphrase, never stored in plaintext).
Federation Impact:
● Rotated keys must propagate via ActivityPub Update activities for actor objects.
A2. Multi-Device Linking (Added Feature)
Applies to: Module A – Identity & User Autonomy
Requirements:
● Users may authorize additional devices.
● Each device generates its own keypair.
● Primary device signs a Device Authorization Object linking the new public key to the
DID.
● Server accepts multiple active public keys per identity.
E1. Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection (Added Feature)
Applies to: Module E – Federation & Resilience
